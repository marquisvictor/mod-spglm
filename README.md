# mod-spglm

This is a revised version of the original [spglm](https://github.com/pysal/spglm) package from the PySal distribution, that includes the capability of computing the Geographically weighted (GW) correlation coefficient by incorporating a standardization process after geographic weighting in the beta computation routine (`_compute_betas_gwr()`).
